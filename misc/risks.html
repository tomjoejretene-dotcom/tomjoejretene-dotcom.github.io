<h1>Technology Risks</h1>


</ul><h4><p> Despite these advancements, robotic prosthetics come with a range of technical, economic, and ethical challenges. One of the most significant barriers is economic inequality. High-end prosthetic limbs can cost tens of thousands of dollars, and ongoing maintenance or software updates further increase the lifetime cost (Mouzo, 2022). This creates a divide between individuals who can afford advanced bionics and those who rely on basic mechanical alternatives. For many people, particularly in developing nations, access to such life-changing technologies remains out of reach.

Another concern is technological reliability and safety. Complex prosthetic systems depend on sensors, batteries, and connectivity to function properly. Mechanical malfunctions or software bugs can cause unintentional movements, posing potential harm to the user or others nearby. Moreover, since modern prosthetics often connect wirelessly to computers or cloud-based systems for updates or calibration, they may be susceptible to cybersecurity threats. The prospect of external interference—whether accidental or malicious—raises ethical questions about privacy, autonomy, and bodily integrity (Vujaklija, Farina, & Aszmann, 2016).

Ethical concerns extend beyond immediate safety risks. As prosthetics become capable of enhancement rather than restoration, the line between therapy and augmentation blurs. Bionics initially aimed to restore lost human capabilities, but the same technology could be used to exceed normal limits—offering greater strength, speed, or precision than a biological limb. This raises questions about fairness, particularly in sports or the workforce, where enhanced individuals could gain disproportionate advantages. Philosophically, it also forces society to reconsider what it means to be human, and whether the pursuit of “perfection” through machines undermines the value of natural diversity (Caldwell, 2021).

Another ethical dilemma concerns data and consent. Advanced prosthetics collect sensitive biometric information, such as neural activity or muscle impulses. If this data is stored or transmitted externally, users risk losing control over deeply personal information. Who owns this data—the patient, the manufacturer, or the healthcare provider? Establishing transparent data governance is essential to protect user privacy and autonomy.

Finally, psychological adjustment remains a challenge. While robotic limbs restore physical function, some users struggle with the emotional process of integrating an artificial body part. Feelings of alienation or “cyborg anxiety” are common, particularly during the early stages of adaptation. These psychological factors highlight that prosthetic design must account not only for engineering efficiency but also for the emotional and social dimensions of embodiment.<p></h4>
