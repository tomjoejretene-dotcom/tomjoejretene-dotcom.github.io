  <p><em>Bionics is a revolutionary discipline that has emerged from the intersection of robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), and biomedical engineering. Its primary aim is to merge biological principles with technological innovation to restore or enhance human capabilities. The term “bionics” itself is derived from “biology” and “electronics,” representing the fusion of life sciences with mechanical and computational systems. The field has evolved rapidly in recent decades, particularly with advances in neural engineering, biomechanics, and materials science. The goal of bionics is not merely to create devices that substitute for lost biological functions but to integrate artificial systems that can emulate, extend, or even surpass natural human processes (Herr, 2014).

A key branch of bionics focuses on robotic prosthetics, which has transformed the lives of millions of amputees worldwide. Traditional prosthetic limbs were primarily mechanical, relying on body power or external cables for movement. In contrast, modern bionic prostheses use a combination of microprocessors, myoelectric sensors, and AI algorithms to interpret electrical signals from the user’s muscles or nerves, translating them into coordinated movement. These devices detect user intent and execute precise actions, providing smoother and more natural motion than ever before (Resnik, Klinger, & Etter, 2019). The development of such prosthetic systems represents a paradigm shift—from passive mechanical replacements to cognitive extensions of the human body, capable of learning, adapting, and interacting seamlessly with their users.

Beyond individual rehabilitation, the rise of bionics symbolizes a broader transformation in how society understands the relationship between humans and machines. It challenges conventional definitions of ability, identity, and the boundaries of the human form. This essay explores the opportunities, risks, choices, social impacts, and ethical considerations of robotic prosthetics, emphasizing how they reshape both personal lives and collective values.</p></em>

      Ethical issue - power or equity; Technology - medical, nuclear, mobile?</p></em>
